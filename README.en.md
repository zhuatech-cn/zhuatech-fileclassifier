## 2026-10-23: Explainable filename routing and conflicts

This update implements **Explainable filename routing and conflicts** on the backend, with structured input, explicit validation, evidence or exception details, and a responsive utility page at `/practical.html`. Results are computed from submitted data, not fixed demo responses.

The new endpoint is disabled (503) until the administrator sets an independent 32–256 printable ASCII character ZHUATECH_PRACTICAL_TOKEN. Enter it in the utility page; it is kept only in page memory, never embedded in source or browser storage. Use `POST /api/practical/explainable-file-routing`. No external model invocation or business posting occurs. See [algorithm, sample, boundaries and test commands](docs/AI_MULTIMODAL_UPGRADE_20261023.md).

# ZhuaTech File Classifier

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for enterprise business operations and digital management.

ZhuaTech File Classifier provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for enterprise business operations and digital management. It is designed for business users, process owners, approvers, and system administrators, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise fileclassifier, self-hosted fileclassifier, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Product Scope

- **Primary users:** Business users, process owners, approvers, and system administrators.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Capability Map

- **File Classification** — Manage file classification with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **Analysis Task** — Coordinate analysis task through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Audit Log** — Track audit log metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Business master data** — Preserve business master data evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Lifecycle workflow and approvals** — Expose lifecycle workflow and approvals in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **User and administration workspaces** — Connect user and administration workspaces to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Technology Baseline

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Responsive HTML5 · MySQL 8 · Docker Compose

### Repository Layout

- `backend/` — Java backend, domain services, APIs, validation, and automated tests
- `frontend/` — responsive user and administration interfaces
- `database/` — database schema, migrations, or demonstration data
- `deploy/` — deployment and operations resources
- `docs/` — architecture, operations, screenshots, and supporting documentation
- `compose.yaml` — local multi-service orchestration

## Run Locally

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

- Review `compose.yaml` before changing published ports, storage paths, or production credentials.

## Verification

Run the checks supported by this repository before changing or deploying it:

```bash
cd backend && mvn test
```

## Security and Production Readiness

- Never commit real passwords, API keys, tokens, certificates, customer data, or production connection strings.
- Replace all local demonstration credentials and secrets before deployment.
- Apply least privilege, tenant isolation, backup and restore drills, monitoring, rate limiting, and vulnerability management.
- Please report security issues privately through the contact channels below instead of publishing sensitive details.
